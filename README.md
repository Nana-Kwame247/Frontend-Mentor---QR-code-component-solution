## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

After completing the HTML and CSS part of 110devs! with flexbox I felt it was time i tried my hands on building projects starting from just HTML and CSS.
It was challenging to begin with and had to re do it three times but i finally got it and understood how flex containers work.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <div class="container">
      <div class="box">
        <div class="hero">
          <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code" />
          <p class="first-para">
            Improve your front-end <br />
            skills by building projects
          </p>
          <p class="second-para">
            Scan the QR code to visit Frontend <br />Mentor and take your coding
            skills to <br />
            <span class="three">the next level</span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 50px 0;
}

.hero {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

My goal is to focus on building more projects daily especially with flexbox because it seems really easy when I watch tutorial videos but I am still figuring out it's implementation.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to remember and use flexbox properties and going forward I plan to use it more. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - I had some difficulties positioning the image but stackoverflow was there to help
